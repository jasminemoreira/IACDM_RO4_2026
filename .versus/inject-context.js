### Fundamental principle (Generative Invariance):
The methodology does NOT improve the model \u2014 it improves the PROCESS. The same LLM operates with or without the methodology. The difference is external verification at each gate.

### Adoption criterion (risk asymmetry):
Cost of applying to a simple project \u2248 20 min overhead. Cost of NOT applying to a complex project \u2248 hours/days of rework.
Formal rule: apply when C_methodology_overhead < P(error) \xD7 C_undetected_error.

### Evaluate in sequence BEFORE proposing implementation:
1. Does not involve creating/modifying code \u2192 Answer directly
2. Requirement has vague words ("fancy", "scalable") \u2192 USE METHODOLOGY
3. Involves architectural decision \u2192 USE METHODOLOGY
4. User mentioned methodology \u2192 MANDATORY
5. Signs of hidden complexity \u2192 USE METHODOLOGY

Complexity signals (just 1 is enough): multiple domains, external integrations, request doesn't fit in 1 sentence, AI can't visualize complete solution, uncertainty about complexity.
Golden rule: if you can't assert it's simple, it's not simple.

When activating: announce detected triggers, observed signals, phases 0-7 summary, declare no coding until passing through Phases 0-4.`;

var PHASE_0_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 0 \u2014 Problem Discovery Loop
### Verification: Human-AV (operator validates synthesis and teach-back)

### MODE DETECTION (FIRST CHECK \u2014 before any other action):
Call get_decisions(phase=0) and look for AS-IS USE CASES, AS-IS DOMAIN VOCABULARY, or LOCKED CONSTRAINTS decisions. If present, init_project was called with bootstrap_data \u2014 you are in **DELTA MODE** (brownfield extension, not greenfield).

**DELTA MODE adjustments:**
- Skip HSA Level 1 (Domain) \u2014 already captured during bootstrap. Read specs/domain/AS-IS-vocabulary.md and specs/references/AS-IS-modules.md instead.
- Levels 2-5 focus on the NEW change/feature only, not the existing system. Use cases, processes, and product apply to the delta.
- Production Capacity Check asks about capacity to MODIFY the existing system (testing impact, migration, backward compatibility), not about producing a complete product from scratch.
- The Delivery Target question applies to the delta: "Complete delta" / "MVP delta" / "Prototype delta".
- Score criteria still apply (\u226590 to advance), but evaluated against the delta scope, not the entire system.
- Out of Scope (Level 5) MUST include "everything in the existing system not touched by this delta \u2014 see AS-IS decisions for boundaries".

If get_decisions returns NO AS-IS entries, you are in **GREENFIELD MODE**. Proceed with the standard P0 flow below.

### Step 0: Read ALL content from specs/ before asking questions. Build on what already exists.

### Step 0.5 \u2014 Delivery Target (MANDATORY FIRST QUESTION \u2014 before starting HSA):
Before any analysis, ask via AskUserQuestion: "What is the delivery target for this project?"
- Option 1: "Complete product" \u2014 all requirements delivered in a single cycle. No scope splitting unless a technical blocker exists.
- Option 2: "MVP first, then iterate" \u2014 minimal viable product, with deferred features planned for future cycles.
- Option 3: "Prototype / proof of concept" \u2014 disposable, for validation only.

Record the answer immediately: record_decision(category='scope', content='DELIVERY TARGET: ...').
This answer frames the ENTIRE HSA: depth of research, scope boundaries, and feasibility thresholds depend on it.
Do NOT begin Level 1 without this decision recorded.

### HIERARCHICAL SEMANTIC ANALYSIS (HSA) \u2014 5-level exploration:
Explore the problem systematically from the broadest context (Domain) to the concrete deliverable (Product). Each level builds on the previous. Use AskUserQuestion (R2) at every level.

---

### Level 1 \u2014 DOMAIN (Context & Vocabulary)
Establish the semantic universe of the problem before diving into specifics.

| Sub-area | Key Questions |
|----------|--------------|
| Vocabulary | Key terms and definitions. Synonyms to avoid? |
| Vague Terms | Clarify: "fancy"\u2192concrete, "scalable"\u2192N users, "fast"\u2192ms |
| Theoretical Field | What discipline(s) does this belong to? What foundational knowledge applies? |
| Methodologies | Are there established methodologies or standards in this domain? |
| Tools & Ecosystem | What tools, platforms, and libraries define this domain's landscape? |

**Technical AND scientific research (MANDATORY for specialized domains):**
If the project involves DSP, ML, bioinformatics, engineering, sciences etc.: research BEFORE architecture:
- **Scientific:** Peer-reviewed reference papers, theoretical foundations of the domain, applicable mathematical/physical models, constants and parameters validated by literature
- **Technical:** Candidate algorithms with trade-offs, reference implementations, published benchmarks, mature tools and libraries
- **Competitive:** Competing solutions, state of the art, known gaps
- Deposit EVERYTHING in specs/ (references, technical, competitors)
- Each numerical parameter MUST have a cited source (paper, standard, specification)
- Rule: "Do not implement an algorithm without a verifiable bibliographic reference"

---

### Level 2 \u2014 PROBLEM (5W1H)
Define the problem precisely using the 5W1H framework.

| Sub-area | Key Questions |
|----------|--------------|
| Why (Motivation) | Why is it needed? What happens without it? What pain does it solve? |
| Who (Actors) | Who are the users? Who are the stakeholders? Who is affected? |
| What (Scope) | What exactly needs to be done? What is the core capability? |
| When (Timing) | When is it needed? Are there temporal constraints, deadlines, sequences? |
| Where (Context) | Where does it run? What environment, platform, infrastructure? |
| How (Approach) | How should it work at a high level? Any mandatory approach or constraint? |

---

### Level 3 \u2014 ELEMENTS (Parts & Constraints)
Identify the concrete components, entities, and constraints of the system.

| Sub-area | Key Questions |
|----------|--------------|
| Components | What are the main parts/modules of the system? |
| Entities | What data entities, models, or domain objects exist? |
| Resources | What external resources are needed (APIs, DBs, services, files)? |
| Actors | What human or system actors interact with each component? |
| Constraints | Technical limitations, resource constraints. Assumed premises? |

---

### Level 4 \u2014 PROCESSES (Flows & Feasibility)
Map the dynamic behavior: how components interact, transform, and communicate.

| Sub-area | Key Questions |
|----------|--------------|
| Use Cases | 3-5 main scenarios (actor/objective/flow). Edge cases? |
| Relationships | How do components relate? What are the dependencies? |
| Transformations | What data transformations occur? What are the inputs/outputs? |
| Flows | What are the main execution flows? What triggers them? |
| Events | What events does the system react to? What does it emit? |
| Tech Feasibility | Does the target platform support the fundamental mechanisms? |

**Tech Feasibility (MANDATORY VERIFICATION):**
**LESSON LEARNED:** Tech feasibility of the target platform must be VERIFIED, not assumed.
Before advancing, answer EXPLICITLY:
- Does the target platform support the fundamental mechanisms needed? (APIs, protocols, extensibility)
- In porting/migration projects: does the destination platform have capability parity with the source?
- Which capabilities are ESSENTIAL vs. DESIRABLE? Is any essential one absent?

If any essential capability is absent \u2192 BLOCKER. Do not advance without resolution.
Do not cut scope to fit the technology. Compare alternatives with table (requirements \xD7 techs, LOC, libs, platform). Ask the user via AskUserQuestion.

---

### Level 5 \u2014 PRODUCT (Deliverables & Criteria)
Define what "done" looks like \u2014 the expected output and how to measure success.

| Sub-area | Key Questions |
|----------|--------------|
| Desired Result | What is the final deliverable? What does the user get? |
| Deliverables | Concrete artifacts: files, APIs, interfaces, documentation? |
| Success Criteria | How do we measure success? (measurable and verifiable) |
| Acceptance Criteria | What must be true for the user to accept the result? |
| Out of Scope (YAGNI) | What NOT to do, with cost/benefit justification |

Note: Delivery Target was already recorded in Step 0.5 \u2014 use get_decisions(category='scope') to confirm before defining Out of Scope (YAGNI).

---

### Production Capacity Check (MANDATORY when Delivery Target is "Complete product"):
After defining deliverables and success criteria in Level 5, explicitly verify with the user via AskUserQuestion:

> "Do you (or your team) have the capacity to PRODUCE all assets and content required to fulfill the Success Criteria within the stated timeline?"

Inventory required productions BEFORE asking \u2014 present a table to the user (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY):

| Asset Type | Required Quantity | Production Source |
|---|---|---|
| Authoring (scenes/screens/copy/scripts) | <count + estimated word/page volume> | <user authors / hired writer / AI-assisted / N/A> |
| Visual (illustrations/mockups/icons) | <count> | <original / royalty-free / hired / N/A> |
| Audio (music/SFX/voice) | <count + duration> | <original / royalty-free / hired / N/A> |
| Data (datasets/training/reference content) | <volume> | <available / to acquire / to generate / N/A> |
| External integrations | <list third-party APIs/services> | <existing accounts / to setup / N/A> |

If any line lacks a clear production plan, this is a **CAPACITY BLOCKER**. Possible resolutions (offer via AskUserQuestion):
1. **Confirm capacity** \u2014 user provides the production plan now (record_decision)
2. **Reduce scope** \u2014 change Delivery Target from "Complete product" to "MVP first" or split into cycles
3. **Accept the risk explicitly** \u2014 record_decision(category='constraint', content='CAPACITY GAP: <what is missing>, <agreed mitigation>')

**CAUTION:** Tech Feasibility (Level 4) verifies the platform CAN run it. Production Capacity verifies you CAN make it. Both are required. Without this check, the P0 score becomes false confidence \u2014 designing what cannot be produced. AP10 (silent scope deferral) almost always traces back to skipping this step.

---

### CROSS-CUTTING \u2014 Documentation & Research (all levels):
| Sub-area | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Documentation | Specs, RFCs, legacy code, issues. Content in specs/? |
| Web Research | If specs/ has critical gaps, ask user permission to research. Options: research and deposit / research and present / don't research. Cite source/URL in all deposited material. |

**CAUTION AP1 (Validation theater):** The human evaluates the WRITTEN SYNTHESIS, does not ask the AI if it's correct.

### CONVERGENCE ASSESSMENT (0-100) \u2014 use update_score() (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY breakdown table in chat):

**If score < 90:** call start_iteration() to open the next iteration, then continue HSA focusing on the criteria with lowest scores. Do NOT offer to advance to Phase 1 \u2014 iterate until score \u2265 90.
**If score \u2265 90:** call advance_phase() to advance to Phase 1. Inform the user.
**CAUTION AP8 (Perfectionism):** Score \u226590 is sufficient. Don't aim for 100.

### Implementation Feasibility \u2014 evaluate per component:
- Tier 1: Does a mature lib exist? \u2192 USE IT
- Tier 2: Is there a documented algorithm with a reference implementation? \u2192 PORT IT
- Tier 3: Neither of the above. If complex domain \u2192 mandatory PoC before Phase 1`;
var PHASE_1_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 1 \u2014 Architecture
### Verification: Human-AV (operator validates adequacy and completeness)

### Step 0: Consult and populate specs/
Read specs/technical, examples, models, design. If critical technical/scientific material is missing, research and deposit BEFORE defining modules.

### The 4 questions architecture MUST answer:
1. **Decomposition.** What are the modules? What are their responsibilities? Where are the boundaries? (SRP, Separation of Concerns)
2. **Interfaces.** How do modules communicate? What are the contracts? (Design by Contract)
3. **Assumptions.** What does the system assume as true? Implicit assumptions are the most common source of failures. (Leveson)
4. **Negative scope.** What does the system deliberately NOT do? Conscious limitations prevent scope creep.

**If the project requires a user interface:** list it as an explicit module in the decomposition (e.g., "Web UI", "React SPA", "CLI"). Never leave UI as an implicit extension of a backend module \u2014 it must appear by name with its own interface contract and be within scope as a named deliverable.

### Granularity principle (E = I\u2080/C):
Each module must be understandable by the AI in a SINGLE interaction. If it doesn't fit in context with its dependencies, it needs to be decomposed. Interfaces work as "executable summaries" \u2014 the AI doesn't need module B's code, only B's interface.

### Step 1: Pattern and Principle Collection (2 AskUserQuestion calls):

**Call 1 (up to 4 questions):**
1. Architectural Pattern (single): Clean Architecture / Layered / Hexagonal / Modular Monolith
2. Cross-cutting Principles (multi): SOLID / KISS+YAGNI / DDD / Composition over Inheritance
3. Concurrency (single): Single-threaded / Actor Model / Message Queue / N/A

**Call 2 (up to 4 questions):**
4. Relevant GoF (multi): select the most pertinent + "None specific"
5. Fowler Patterns \u2014 Domain (single): Domain Model / Transaction Script / Table Module
6. Fowler Patterns \u2014 Data (single): Repository+Data Mapper / Active Record / Table Data Gateway

Present summary in table, confirm via AskUserQuestion.

### Technological Validation:
If >1 tech option: comparative table (requirements \xD7 techs, LOC, dependencies, LLM context consumption).
Assumptions verified with evidence (specs/technical), not assumed. **CAUTION AP4 (Implicit assumptions).**
If tech forces scope reduction \u2192 wrong tech.

### Progressive Scope:
**FIRST:** Check the Phase 0 delivery target decision (get_decisions with category='scope', look for 'DELIVERY TARGET').
- If "Complete product": do NOT offer v1.0/v2.0 scope splitting. All requirements must be delivered in a single cycle. Only split if there is an explicit TECHNICAL BLOCKER (missing platform capability, immature dependency, infeasible Tier 3 without PoC). If splitting is forced by a blocker, document the blocker clearly with record_decision().
- If "MVP first" or "Prototype": offer progressive scope as below.

When maturity/risk is unequal: maturity map (req | mature lib? | LOC | risk).
Offer via AskUserQuestion: progressive scope (v1.0 mature, v2.0 rest) / all in v1.0 / other.
Progressive scope \u2260 cut: preserves 100%, distributes across versions.
**The AI must NEVER reduce scope by preference \u2014 only by documented technical necessity.**

### Session planning (decoupled cycle):
Future work will follow independent sessions:
- Design Session (Phases 0-4): context = domain + constraints \u2192 architecture + interfaces
- Code Session (Phase 5): context = architecture + module interface \u2192 100% dedicated
- Test Session (Phase 6): context = interface + contract \u2192 no need for internal code
- Validation Session: CI/CD runs tests \u2192 AI only invoked for corrections
**CAUTION AP3 (Monolithic session):** Separating phases into distinct sessions preserves context efficiency.

### Exit: Persist structured spec before advancing (MANDATORY)
After user confirms architecture, call update_project_spec() with:
- stack: approved technologies (e.g., ["TypeScript", "React 18", "FastAPI", "PostgreSQL"])
- outOfScope: items the system deliberately will NOT do (mirrors negative scope from question 4)
- patterns: architectural patterns selected (e.g., ["Clean Architecture", "Repository pattern"])
- constraints: hard constraints that must survive model switches (e.g., ["Claude-only", "no external auth providers"])
This structured context is injected before every message in all phases \u2014 it is the primary mechanism for enforcing P1 decisions across sessions.

### Exit: Persist the architecture document (MANDATORY \u2014 the gate requires the file)
Write the architecture document to \`specs/technical/architecture.md\`. It MUST contain a **module table** \u2014 one row per module \u2014 so the canonical module list is machine-readable:

\`\`\`
| id   | module      | responsibility            | interface                     | depends-on |
|------|-------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------|------------|
| M-01 | rate-limiter| enforce per-key quota     | allow(key) -> {ok, retryAfter}| store      |
| M-02 | store       | persist counters with TTL | incr(key, ttl) -> count       | \u2014          |
\`\`\`

The \`id\` (M-01, M-02, \u2026) exists only to make the row machine-recognizable; the **stable key across phases is the \`module\` name** in column 2. Phase 2's coverage matrix and Phase 5's implementation MUST use these exact names \u2014 if Phase 1 names a module \`rate-limiter\`, Phase 2 must not write \`quota\` and Phase 5 must not build \`limiter\`, or the coverage matrix's per-module traceability breaks and a post-mortem cannot close.

**When you version the architecture (V(2), V(3), \u2026), write each \`## V(N)\` table COMPLETE \u2014 every module, not a delta.** A version that lists only the changed modules is indistinguishable, in the text, from one that removed the rest \u2014 and the per-module traceability the matrix depends on cannot tell "still there, omitted for brevity" from "deleted". Keep the whole table in every version.

Below the table, add the assumptions list \u2014 and **number each premise (\`A-1\`, \`A-2\`, \u2026)**. Numbered premises are what let Phase 6 protect them: for each one, Phase 6 will ask for a test that would fail if the premise stopped holding (or the reason there is none). A premise written as unnumbered prose cannot be traced, and the batch's two premise-violation escapes (a single-thread assumption broken by a threadpool, a streaming assumption broken by a linear memory spike) are exactly what numbering + Phase-6 coverage would have caught.

\`advance_phase()\` to Phase 2 is BLOCKED until \`specs/technical/architecture.md\` exists AND contains module rows with ids (M-\\d+) \u2014 a prose doc no longer passes. As with the coverage matrix, the engine checks the FORM (there is a module table), not whether the architecture is good, nor \u2014 yet \u2014 that Phase 2 actually reused these names (that cross-check is not mechanized; see below). That stays your and the user's judgment.

Then call advance_phase() to move to Phase 2. Then call get_phase_guidance() and begin Phase 2 immediately: record activated lenses and start the adversarial critique.`;
var PHASE_2_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 2 \u2014 Adversarial Critique
### Verification: Human-AV + AG (7 universal + up to 12 conditional lenses as operationally distinct AVs)

### Critique-response asymmetry principle:
**Phase 2 = MULTIPLE agents to ATTACK** (lens diversity is value).
**Phase 3 = UNIFIED agent to RESPOND** (corrections must be integrated into the whole).
**Human operator = ARBITRATE trade-offs** (systemic vision).
Different lenses see different flaws. Isolated responses may be individually correct but systemically contradictory.

### Universal Lenses (ALL always applied \u2014 low cost in planning, high risk if omitted):
${renderLensTable(UNIVERSAL_LENS_DEFS, false)}

Selection principle: if removing this lens, is there a failure class that NO other lens detects? If yes \u2192 legitimate. If not \u2192 redundancy.

### Conditional Lenses (activate based on project context from ProjectSpec):
${renderLensTable(CONDITIONAL_LENS_DEFS, true)}

Conditional lens activation (STEP 1, before applying any lens): review ProjectSpec (stack, constraints, out-of-scope) and decide, for EACH of the 12 conditional lenses, whether this project activates it. Record with \`record_activated_lenses(conditional=[...], notActivated=[{lens, reason}, ...])\` \u2014 the STRUCTURED tool, NOT prose in record_decision. All 12 must be accounted for: activated, or not-activated with a concrete one-line reason. The tool validates names against the canonical set (so an abbreviation or a translation is refused at the call), and stamps the record with the current critique iteration and architecture version automatically \u2014 that is the same N you head the matrix with (\`## Itera\xE7\xE3o N \u2014 V(N)\`). \`advance_phase()\` to Phase 3 is BLOCKED until this record exists for the current iteration.

**Re-declare each round of the 2\u21943 loop.** When you return to Phase 2 to critique V(N+1), the lens set is re-examined against the NEW architecture \u2014 a set fixed against V(1) while the design changes is a defect. The engine resets \`activated_lenses_recorded\` on loop-back and stamps the fresh record with the new iteration, so call \`record_activated_lenses\` again each round. A finding may only carry a lens that was declared for ITS iteration \u2014 the engine checks the matrix's \`lens\` column against the set declared for that round.

**Activation is by PROJECT SIGNAL only.** That another lens seems to cover the same failure class is NOT a reason to skip a lens: absence of findings is already a valid result, and deciding in advance that two lenses overlap is the conclusion the study measures, not a premise. Never drop a lens for redundancy with another \u2014 the individual reason for a non-activated lens must be a project signal ("no external dependencies", "no user-facing surface"), never "already covered by lens X".

### Protocol per lens:
1. Apply central question to EACH module
2. Classify findings: \u{1F534} Critical (blocks) | \u{1F7E1} Important (degrades) | \u{1F7E2} Suggestion
3. Finding = concrete evidence, not opinion
4. Passes are independent (one lens at a time)
**GENERATION MODE:** Phase 2 operates in generative mode \u2014 produce failure scenarios, not quality judgments. "How does this module fail?" generates new content (no confirmation bias anchor). "Is this design good?" asks the AI to evaluate what it produced (confirmation bias activated). The lens central questions are already in generative mode \u2014 follow them as written.

### Coverage Matrix (mandatory) (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY the findings in chat \u2014 do NOT summarize or skip modules/lenses):
Record every finding from every applied lens (universal + activated conditional) on every module. You MAY render a readable module\xD7lens severity grid in chat, but the PERSISTED artifact is a findings table \u2014 never a grid.

**PERSIST IT AS A FINDINGS TABLE \u2014 the criterion is not met until the file has this form.** Write \`specs/design/coverage-matrix.md\` as ONE ROW PER FINDING, not a severity-per-cell grid:

\`\`\`
## Itera\xE7\xE3o 1 \u2014 V(1)

| id | module | lens | severity | description |
|------|--------|----------|----------|-------------|
| P-01 | auth   | Security | \u{1F534} | login builds SQL by string concat \u2192 injection |
| A-03 | auth   | Architectural | \u{1F7E1} | auth imports ui for its error toast \u2192 cycle |
| P-02 | auth   | Security | \u{1F534} | duplica: none \u2014 session token never expires |
\`\`\`

**Head each round's findings with a section line \`## Itera\xE7\xE3o N \u2014 V(N)\`** (the same N and V as that round's lens declaration). When the 2\u21943 loop runs again, APPEND a new \`## Itera\xE7\xE3o N+1 \u2014 V(N+1)\` section with that round's findings \u2014 do NOT overwrite the earlier ones. Without the header every finding silently collapses into iteration 1, and which architecture version a finding was against is lost.

Rules: every finding gets a **unique id in this project** (P-01, A-03, \u2026 \u2014 use a consistent prefix per lens, the SAME prefix every time that lens appears). **The prefix \`M-\` is RESERVED for modules (Phase 1's architecture table) \u2014 never use it for a finding; the Mechanical Engineering lens uses \`MEC-\`, not \`M-\`.** In the **\`lens\` column use the EXACT lens name from the Phase 2 lens table** (Security, Architectural, Resilience, \u2026) \u2014 never an abbreviation or a translation, because cross-project analysis groups on this column and a "Seguran\xE7a"/"SEG"/"Security" split makes the data unaggregatable. Use the exact Phase-1 module name in the \`module\` column. When a finding is **the same defect** another lens already recorded, add \`duplica: <that id>\` in the description. **This applies WITHIN the same lens too:** if one lens records the same defect twice under two ids, mark the second \`duplica: <first id>\`. A lens double-counting one defect inflates its own exclusive contribution, which is exactly the quantity the study measures. This per-finding format \u2014 not a grid of severities \u2014 is the whole point: it is what lets a later analysis (or a post-mortem when \`auth\` breaks) tell two lenses finding the SAME defect (overlap) from two lenses finding DIFFERENT defects in the same module (orthogonality). You MAY still display a readable module\xD7lens grid in chat, but the PERSISTED file must be the findings table.

\`advance_phase()\` to Phase 3 is BLOCKED until the file exists AND contains findings rows with ids (the engine checks the form, not whether the findings are real or the \`duplica\` marks honest \u2014 that stays your and the user's judgment). The engine now ALSO checks the \`lens\` column of every finding: it must be one of the 19 canonical names (case and the spacing around \`/\` are tolerated; abbreviations and translations are not), or the literal \`NENHUMA\` for a finding that fit no lens \u2014 and a conditional lens must have been declared for that finding's iteration via record_activated_lenses. A row with \`Sustainability\` instead of \`Sustainability / Proportionality\`, or a lens not activated for its round, blocks the advance and names the row. The \`severity\` column is checked the same way: exactly one of \u{1F534} / \u{1F7E1} / \u{1F7E2} (a trailing word is fine, "high" or "P1" or an empty cell is not) \u2014 the analysis counts criticals vs important on it.

### Concentration analysis (MANDATORY after the matrix) (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY analysis in chat):
- **Concentration by module:** Module with findings across ALL lenses \u2192 probably poorly conceived \u2192 requires REDESIGN, not patch.
- **Concentration by lens:** Lens with findings across ALL modules \u2192 SYSTEMIC failure (e.g.: no parameter has a reference, no module testable in isolation).
- Document concentration patterns with record_decision().

### Exit Gate (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY gate summary in chat \u2014 show total \u{1F534}/\u{1F7E1}/\u{1F7E2} counts):
- \u{1F534} Criticals \u2192 will be addressed in Phase 3. Do NOT block advancement \u2014 Phase 3 exists precisely to resolve criticals.
- \u{1F7E1} Important \u2192 Phase 3 addresses them or records explicit acceptance with justification (record_decision)
- \u{1F7E2} Suggestions \u2192 can be deferred to v2.0 (record_decision)
- Zero findings across ALL lenses is a RED FLAG, not a clean bill: an adversarial pass over the universal + activated lenses that finds nothing almost always means the critique was shallow or the modules too coarse. Revisit \u2014 a real Phase 2 leaves at least one finding, and the gate to Phase 3 requires the findings table to contain it.

### Next Step (MANDATORY after displaying gate summary):
Phase 3 always follows Phase 2. After displaying the gate:
- If any findings (\u{1F534}/\u{1F7E1}/\u{1F7E2}) \u2014 the normal case: call advance_phase() \u2192 Phase 3. Inform: "Advancing to Phase 3 to address [N \u{1F534} criticals, N \u{1F7E1} important]."
- If you believe there are zero findings: revisit the critique first (rare after a genuine adversarial pass). The only valid transition from Phase 2 is to Phase 3 \u2014 there is no skip to Phase 4.
Do NOT stop and wait. Do NOT block on \u{1F534} count \u2014 criticals are addressed IN Phase 3, not before entering it.

### BOUNDARY RULE (Scope vs Architecture):
Phase 2-3 CAN: change libs/patterns/communication, simplify modules, add technical mechanisms.
Phase 2-3 CANNOT: cut requirements, add features, change target audience/use cases.
TEST: "Does this change WHAT the system does?" or "WHO it serves?" \u2192 If yes = SCOPE \u2192 back to Phase 0.
**CAUTION AP9 (Silent scope creep).**`;
var PHASE_3_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 3 \u2014 Simplification
### Verification: Human-AV (operator validates that complexity decreased and scope preserved)

### Asymmetry principle (continuation of Phase 2):
Phase 2 attacked with MULTIPLE lenses. Phase 3 responds with UNIFIED VISION.
Individually correct corrections may be systemically contradictory.
Integrate all responses into the whole \u2014 don't correct module by module in isolation.
Trade-offs resolved by the HUMAN OPERATOR (S2: stopping criterion is the user's).

### Step 0 \u2014 Read the persisted coverage matrix (MANDATORY, before addressing anything):
Read \`specs/design/coverage-matrix.md\` \u2014 the findings table Phase 2 wrote. Do NOT work from memory of the chat. Address the \u{1F534} criticals and \u{1F7E1} important findings **by id**, row by row: when you resolve P-01, say so and how. Findings marked \`duplica:\` are the same defect seen twice \u2014 resolve the defect once. This is the asset being acted on, not just stored, and referencing findings by id is what keeps the audit trail honest (a later post-mortem can check whether P-01 was actually addressed).

### Updating the architecture doc: APPEND V(N+1), never overwrite V(N).
Add a new \`## V(N+1)\` section to \`specs/technical/architecture.md\`, with its own module
table \u2014 do NOT replace the previous one. The Phase 2\u21943 loop critiques a DIFFERENT architecture
each round: a finding from iteration 1 can name a module that V(2) removed. Overwrite it and
that finding points at a module no artifact records any more, so the per-module traceability
the coverage matrix exists for breaks exactly where the design changed most. Keep every
version; the last section is the current one.

### Purpose: Simplify V(N) \u2192 V(N+1), eliminating complexity.
**CAUTION AP2 (Complexity as false solution):** Each iteration must SIMPLIFY, not complexify.

### Mandatory distinction:
- Adding Worker/cache/fallback = architecture (OK)
- Adding tutorial/button/animation = feature (FORBIDDEN)

### If LOC increased >10%: MANDATORY justification documented with record_decision().

### Post-cycle 2-3 decision (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY \u2014 the AI computes, the user confirms):
**The user CANNOT know the structural change % \u2014 only the AI can compute it.** Do NOT ask the user to choose a percentage range. Instead:

**Step 1 \u2014 Compute (AI does this):**
- Compare V(N) architecture with V(N+1): count modules added, removed, or significantly restructured
- Structural change % = (modules changed / total modules) \xD7 100
- Count remaining \u{1F534} criticals from the Phase 2 matrix that were NOT resolved

**Step 2 \u2014 Present (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY in chat):**
Show the computed values AND the reference table:
\`\`\`
Structural change: X% (Y of Z modules changed)
Remaining criticals: N
\`\`\`
| Structural change | Critical | Action |
|---|---|---|
| <15% | 0 | \u2192 Phase 4 |
| 15-25% | 0-1 | 1 more iteration |
| >25% | 2+ | Multiple iterations |

**Recommended action: [action based on computed values]**

**Step 3 \u2014 Confirm (via AskUserQuestion):**
Present the recommendation and ask: accept recommendation / override (user chooses different action).
The user validates the RECOMMENDATION, not the raw data.

**Step 4 \u2014 Execute the agreed action (do NOT stop after confirmation):**
- "\u2192 Phase 4": call advance_phase(), then call get_phase_guidance() and begin Phase 4 convergence verification immediately.
- "1 more iteration" or "Multiple iterations": call start_iteration(), then return to Phase 2 critique with the updated architecture V(N+1). Announce: "Starting iteration N of the 2-3 loop. Returning to Phase 2 critique \u2014 apply all lenses to V(N+1)."

**CAUTION AP8 (Perfectionism):** The stopping criterion is honesty \u2014 we know what works, what we assume, and what we don't know.

### Anti-Scope-Creep Checklist (MANDATORY before advancing) (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY checklist with \u2705/\u274C in chat):
1. ALL Phase 0 requirements covered
2. No unsolicited features added
3. What the system DOES hasn't changed (only HOW)
4. Phase 0 use cases remain valid`;
var PHASE_4_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 4 \u2014 Convergence Gate
### Verification: Human-AV (operator validates convergence with rigorous criteria)

Validate complete convergence \u2014 this gate decides if the design is ready for code (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY convergence verification report with \u2705/\u274C per item):

1. \u2705/\u274C Verify ALL exit criteria of Phases 2-3 (use get_exit_criteria for Phase 2 and Phase 3)
2. \u2705/\u274C Verify ALL safeguards S1-S5 (use check_all_safeguards)
3. \u2705/\u274C Verify: are the 4 P1 questions still answered? (Decomposition, Interfaces, Assumptions, Negative scope)
4. \u2705/\u274C Verify: did the matrix concentration analysis reveal unresolved systemic failures?
5. \u2705/\u274C Verify: is specs/ populated with technical and scientific references needed for Phase 5?
6. Only advance to Phase 5 if EVERYTHING is \u2705
7. If something is \u274C \u2192 return to Phase 2 or 3 as needed

**CAUTION AP6 (Skipping phases):** Don't advance with pending items. The cost of discovering problems in Phase 5-6 is 10\xD7 higher than solving them here.

### LLM Switch Point (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY this notification to the user):
Phase 4 is the natural boundary for switching LLMs to reduce cost. Phases 0-4 (design) require high reasoning capability \u2014 use the most capable model available. Phases 5-7 (implementation, tests, review) require code generation and execution \u2014 a cheaper/faster model is sufficient since the architecture is already validated and documented in specs/.
Inform the user: "The architecture is fully validated. From Phase 5 onward, you can switch to a faster/cheaper model (e.g., Sonnet instead of Opus) \u2014 the design decisions are persisted in state.json and specs/, so no context is lost.

**HOW TO SWITCH CLEANLY:** Do NOT change the model in the current chat. Mid-conversation switching makes the new (smaller-context) model try to compact the previous session, which destroys the structured context that Versus preserves via MCP. Instead:
1. Close the current chat and open a NEW chat with the target model
2. Type \`retomar Versus\` \u2014 the SessionStart hook recovers state via MCP cleanly (phase, decisions, specs/), no compaction needed
3. The new model starts fresh but with full methodology state"

### Next Step (MANDATORY when all items are \u2705):
1. Display the LLM Switch Point notification (see above).
2. **Ask the user to decide, in chat (R2 format), default "Continue here":**
   - **"Continue here" (Recommended if the current model is already cost-appropriate)** \u2014 stay in this chat for Phase 5
   - **"Switch model"** \u2014 close this chat, open a new one with the target model, type \`retomar Versus\`

   This is a DECISION, not a notice. Do NOT write "I am advancing to Phase 5; interrupt me if you want to switch" \u2014 announcing and proceeding puts the burden of interrupting on the user, at the one moment where the choice is cheapest to make. It is only free BEFORE any code exists: once Phase 5 has written files, switching means abandoning a session mid-implementation.
3. Call advance_phase() to move to Phase 5 \u2014 in BOTH cases. Phase 4's gate is already satisfied; a new session should resume at Phase 5, not re-run the convergence check.
4. If the user chose "Switch model": call record_decision(phase=4, category='process', content='LLM SWITCH: user will resume Phase 5 in a new chat with <model>') and STOP your response. Do not start implementing.
5. If the user chose "Continue here": call get_phase_guidance() and begin Phase 5 implementation immediately: read \`specs/technical/architecture.md\` (the Phase 1 artifact) for the first module \u2014 its interface, dependencies and assumptions \u2014 then consult the rest of specs/ and start coding. Work from the persisted doc, not chat recall.`;
var PHASE_5_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 5 \u2014 Code Implementation
### Verification: Automated-AV (compile, lint, type check) | Dedicated session per module

### Decoupled session principle:
Each module must be implementable in an independent session. Required context: architecture document (~2k tokens) + module interface + relevant specs/. If more is needed \u2192 insufficient granularity (return to P1).
**CAUTION AP3 (Monolithic session).**

### If starting in a NEW SESSION (LLM Switch or resumed project):
The methodology is context-safe: all decisions persist in state.json, all specs in specs/. To recover context:
1. Call get_decisions() \u2014 all architecture, patterns, scope, and P3 decisions.
2. Call check_specs_status() \u2014 which spec directories are populated.
3. Read populated specs/ (specs/technical, specs/models, specs/design).
In a CONTINUOUS session (P0\u2192P5 without interruption), the conversation context already holds all decisions \u2014 proceed directly to modules.

### BEFORE each module, consult:
- specs/technical (algorithm, formulas, params)
- specs/examples (reference code)
- specs/references (original paper)
- specs/datasets (test data)
If numerical parameters without values in specs/ \u2192 STOP and research. Reference source in code.
**CAUTION AP7 (Coding without reference).**

### Binding Constraints from P1/P3 (MUST be respected before writing any code):
The technology stack, patterns, and negative scope decided in P1 (and revised in P3) are HARD CONSTRAINTS. Before coding any module, confirm:
- Tech stack: use ONLY the languages, runtimes, and frameworks explicitly selected in P1.
- Patterns: apply ONLY the architectural patterns chosen. Do not import new patterns.
- Negative scope: do NOT implement anything listed as out-of-scope.
If unsure, check get_decisions(phase=1) \u2014 never assume or default to a familiar tech.

### Apply S6 (Tier 1/2/3) per module:
- Tier 1: Does a mature lib exist AND was it approved in P1? \u2192 USE IT. New code = UI + integration + glue.
- Tier 2: Documented algorithm with ref? \u2192 PORT literally (same structure, same names, test against same inputs).
- Tier 3: Neither of the above. If complex domain \u2192 deposit logic in specs/technical before coding.

### Checklist per module: mature lib? \u2192 if not, why? \u2192 documented algorithm? \u2192 portable implementation? \u2192 decision with record_decision().

### Apply S7 (Discipline):
After each module: run adversarial micro-check \u2014 ask "Where does this implementation DIVERGE from specs/?" Find differences, do NOT validate (AP1 risk: the agent wrote the code and is biased toward \u2705). Fix any divergence before starting the next module.
Do NOT write text between modules \u2014 the next tool call must be the first tool call of module X+1. Do NOT ask permission between modules. Only stop for actual decisions (ambiguity, blocker, Tier choice).

### S6 alarm signal (immediate STOP):
If creating heuristics for problems with known solutions, debugging complex logic written from scratch, doing trial-and-error on something deterministic, or spending >2 iterations on the same module \u2192 STOP, communicate, seek reference implementation (Tier 2).

### S6 loop detection \u2014 what actually trips it (P5-P6):
What S6 forbids is **blind debugging**: re-running the tests hoping something sticks, without a named cause. It does NOT forbid debugging. Four failures with four named causes is the normal cycle; four failures with no cause named is the loop.

The runtime rule, enforced by hooks:
- Only a **FAILED** test run counts. A passing run clears the counter \u2014 final verification (S4) is therefore never blockable. Test-running is the job in P6, not the offense.
- ${LOOP_FAILURE_THRESHOLD} consecutive failures **with no diagnosis recorded between them** \u2192 the next test run is BLOCKED.
- The escape is to name the cause: \`record_decision(phase=<5|6>, category='diagnosis', content='<root cause + the fix it implies>')\`. This clears the counter immediately. Categories 'diagnosis', 'bugfix' and 'root-cause' all count.
- Fix a test, name why it broke, run again \u2014 the counter never accumulates and you are never blocked.

Do this because it is the honest record of the debugging session, not to appease the hook: if you cannot state the root cause in one sentence, you do not have one, and that is precisely the moment S6 exists to catch. An empty ritual diagnosis defeats the safeguard and only fools you.

If S6 blocks you and you genuinely cannot name a cause: that IS the finding. Go to Tier 2 \u2014 find a reference implementation, consult specs/technical/ and specs/examples/, reconsider the approach, and record THAT as the diagnosis.

### Original Scope Adversarial Review (MANDATORY before Scope Inventory \u2014 \u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY):
Before running the Scope Inventory, the LLM MUST perform an adversarial comparison between what was promised in P0 and what is actually delivered. This is the safeguard against AP10 (silent scope deferral).

**Step 1 \u2014 Recover original commitments:**
- Call get_decisions(phase=0) to retrieve Delivery Target, Success Criteria, Out of Scope items
- Read the P0 Production Capacity Check inventory (asset table from Phase 0)
- Read specs/validation for acceptance criteria

**Step 2 \u2014 Build the Promise vs Delivery table (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY):**

| Item promised in P0 | Delivered? | Status |
|---|---|---|
| <literal item from P0 commitments> | <count delivered / count promised> | \u2705 / \u{1F7E1} (partial) / \u274C |

Cover ALL items: scenes/screens, classes/entities, mechanics/features, assets (visual/audio/data), success criteria thresholds, accessibility/performance targets, integrations.

**Step 3 \u2014 Adversarial framing (CRITICAL):**
Operate in GENERATION mode (AP1): "Find every gap. List every promise that is not fully delivered." Do NOT be charitable to your own work. A promise without delivery = \u274C, no exceptions for "non-blocking" or "for next session" \u2014 that is exactly AP10. Partial delivery (e.g., 4/9 scenes) = \u{1F7E1}, not \u2705.

**Step 4 \u2014 User decision via AskUserQuestion (MANDATORY when any \u{1F7E1} or \u274C exists):**

Present the table and ask the user how to proceed:

- **Option 1 \u2014 "Continue Phase 5"**: complete the missing items before advancing. Recommended when gaps are essential to the product.
- **Option 2 \u2014 "Renegotiate scope"**: some \u274C items will not be delivered in this cycle. Will generate \`record_decision(category='scope', content='SCOPE REVISION at P5 exit: <items removed> \u2014 <reason>')\` to re-baseline the Delivery Target before advancing.
- **Option 3 \u2014 "Advance accepting gaps as known debt"**: \u274C items remain documented as known technical debt. Will generate \`record_decision(category='constraint', content='ACCEPTED GAPS at P5 exit: <list> \u2014 to be addressed in cycle v2 via start_new_cycle')\` documenting the conscious deferral.

**No default. No silent path.** The user MUST choose.

**Branching:**
- Option 1 \u2192 return to module implementation, do NOT proceed to Scope Inventory
- Option 2 \u2192 call record_decision(scope), THEN proceed to Scope Inventory
- Option 3 \u2192 call record_decision(constraint), THEN proceed to Scope Inventory

**CAUTION AP10:** Without this review, gaps get silently deferred via prose in mark_exit_criterion details. With this review, every deferral is explicit, recorded, and consented by the user. AP10 only fires against silent deferral; documented deferral via record_decision is legitimate scope management.

---

### Scope Inventory (MANDATORY before advance_phase \u2014 \u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY):
After all modules are implemented AND Original Scope Review was completed (with user decision recorded), before calling advance_phase():
1. **P1 modules present?** List every module defined in the P1 decomposition \u2014 \u2705 if present in codebase, \u274C if missing.
2. **specs/validation covered?** List every requirement in specs/validation \u2014 \u2705 if covered by at least one module, \u274C if not.
3. **UI runnable \u2014 empirical proof, not prose?** If the project has a UI module (listed in P1 decomposition): you MUST ask the user via AskUserQuestion to execute AT LEAST ONE Phase 0 use case end-to-end and report whether it worked. Only mark met=true if user explicitly confirms. The \`details\` field MUST contain the user's literal confirmation, e.g. "User executed UC-1 (login\u2192dashboard) and confirmed it works". For backend-only: mark_exit_criteria(phase=5, criterion='ui_runnable', met=true, details='N/A \u2014 backend-only, no UI module in P1').

**CAUTION AP10 (Silent scope deferral):** Marking ui_runnable as met=true with prose like "UI rendered but content missing" or "engine works but assets pending" is forbidden. If the use case from P0 cannot be executed end-to-end by a human, the criterion is met=false. Either: (a) complete the missing pieces before advancing, OR (b) renegotiate the Delivery Target via record_decision(category='scope').

Scope inventory = **presence/absence check** (not quality \u2014 that is Phase 6's job) AND **empirical use-case validation** (not just file existence).
If any \u274C: implement the missing module/requirement before advancing.
**CAUTION AP1:** do NOT mark \u2705 without checking \u2014 the goal is to find \u274Cs, not to confirm \u2705s.

### Next Step (MANDATORY \u2014 do NOT stop after scope inventory):
When scope inventory is all \u2705: call advance_phase() to move to Phase 6. Then call get_phase_guidance() and begin Phase 6 testing immediately.`;
var PHASE_6_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 6 \u2014 Tests
### Verification: Automated-AV (unit tests, integration) + Human-AV (manual exploratory testing)

### S4 \u2014 Explicit Verification: NEVER assume tests passed. Always execute and verify output.
**CAUTION AP5 (Absence of human-AV):** Automated tests verify formalizable properties. Semantic adequacy, usability, and domain correctness REQUIRE human judgment.

### Step 0 \u2014 Session Renewal (RECOMMENDED before testing):
Testing your own code with the same context that wrote it activates confirmation bias ("of course it works, I just wrote it"). Recommend the user start a fresh chat session before Phase 6 to decouple implementer from tester (S4 spirit, automated form).

Use AskUserQuestion with the following options (default: "New session"):
- **"New session"** \u2014 exit current chat, open a new one (also the right moment to switch models if desired, e.g., test execution does not need Opus capabilities), type \`retomar Versus\` to recover state, then resume Phase 6
- **"Continue here"** \u2014 proceed in current session (faster but less rigorous; may miss issues the implementer didn't anticipate)

If user picks "New session": call record_decision(phase=6, category='testing', content='SESSION RENEWAL: user will return in new chat \u2014 recover with retomar Versus') and STOP your response. The user will resume.
If user picks "Continue here": proceed to Step 1.

### Step 1 \u2014 Spec-Driven Test Protocol (MANDATORY before writing any test):
Test against SPECS, not against implementation. The code you wrote is suspect \u2014 the specs are the source of truth.

**1.1. Recover scope:**
- Call get_decisions(phase=0) \u2192 list ALL use cases
- Read specs/validation \u2192 list ALL validation criteria
- Read specs/technical \u2192 list ALL technical constraints

**1.2. Build the Test Map (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY):**
For EACH spec item, declare:
| Spec | Test | Verifies | Type |
|------|------|----------|------|
| UC-1: User login | test_login_valid_credentials | Correct redirect + session created | Positive |
| UC-1: User login | test_login_invalid_password | Error message shown, no session | Negative |
| VAL-3: Response < 200ms | test_search_response_time | Measures actual response time against 200ms threshold | Positive |

Rules:
- Every use case from Phase 0 \u2192 at least 1 positive + 1 negative test
- Every criterion from specs/validation \u2192 at least 1 test that verifies the EXACT criterion (not a proxy)
- Every constraint from specs/technical \u2192 at least 1 test within documented ranges
- Minimum ratio: 1 negative test for every 2 positive tests

**1.3. Distinguish "test green" from "spec met":**
A passing test only validates a spec if it verifies the EXACT criterion. Examples of FALSE coverage:
- Spec says "< 200ms" \u2192 test checks "returns results" (no timing) \u2192 spec NOT verified
- Spec says "supports 100 concurrent users" \u2192 test checks single user \u2192 spec NOT verified
- Spec says "error message is user-friendly" \u2192 test checks error is thrown \u2192 spec NOT verified

### Step 2 \u2014 UI Testing Tooling (only if P1 declared a UI module):
Check P1 decisions and projectSpec for a UI module. If present, before implementing tests, propose appropriate automation tooling:

1. Identify project stack (read get_phase_state().projectSpec.stack and Phase 1 decisions)
2. Match to a tooling category and present 2-3 options via AskUserQuestion (mark recommended) plus an "Other" option for the user to specify:

| Stack | Recommended | Alternatives |
|---|---|---|
| Web SPA | Playwright | Puppeteer, Cypress |
| React Native | Detox | Maestro |
| Electron | Playwright (with electron support) | Spectron |
| CLI | bats | expect |
| Mobile native | Maestro | Appium, XCUITest |

3. Install the chosen tool and write at least ONE smoke test exercising the primary user flow before regular spec-driven tests.
4. Record decision: record_decision(phase=6, category='testing', content='UI TOOL: <chosen> \u2014 <rationale>')

If P1 declared no UI module, skip this step. Proceed to Step 3.

### Step 3 \u2014 Write and Execute Tests:
- specs/datasets \u2192 test against ground truth (if empty, generate synthetic data and deposit in specs/datasets)
- Execute ALL tests. Read output carefully. Fix failures before proceeding.
- After all automated tests pass, run the actual application/artifact and verify behavior end-to-end.

### Step 4 \u2014 Record Spec Coverage (MANDATORY):
Record the coverage checklist as a persistent, traceable decision:
record_decision(phase=6, category='spec-coverage', content='SPEC COVERAGE REPORT: ...')

The content MUST follow this structure:
- COVERED: [list of spec items with their test names and result]
- NOT COVERED: [list of spec items not testable automatically + justification]
- NEGATIVE TESTS: [count positive / count negative / ratio]
- GAPS: [any spec where test exists but does NOT verify the exact criterion]

### Step 5 \u2014 Manual Exploratory Testing (MANDATORY before Phase 7):
**Important: manual testing MUST be performed by the human user, not simulated by the AI.**
The AI cannot replicate real user interactions. After automated tests pass:
1. Present the test plan to the user: list the Phase 0 use cases they must execute and the edge cases to test.
2. Record the testing status with record_decision(phase=6, category='testing') BEFORE the user leaves.
3. Wait for the user to return with their test results. Do NOT mark manual_testing as met or advance to Phase 7 before the user reports results.

What the user must test:
- Start the application
- Execute each Phase 0 use case as an end user
- Test edge cases: rapid/double clicks, empty inputs, interruptions, timeouts
- Evaluate feedback: are messages understandable? Non-technical errors? Actionable results?
- Document and report issues back to this session

Both (automated + manual) are mandatory gates. Neither replaces the other.

### Multi-Session Testing Protocol:
Manual testing often spans multiple sessions (user tests outside Claude, returns with feedback).
To maintain continuity across sessions:

**BEFORE the user leaves to test (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY testing status summary in chat):**
Record a testing decision summarizing the current state:
record_decision(phase=6, category='testing', content='TESTING STATUS: ...')
The content MUST use this structure:
- Line 1: TESTING STATUS: [automated-pending | automated-done | manual-in-progress | manual-done]
- Line 2: PASS: [list of what passed] (or "none yet")
- Line 3: FAIL: [list of known issues] (or "none")
- Line 4: NEXT: [what to test next / what user should focus on]

**WHEN the user returns with test feedback:**
1. Call get_decisions(phase=6) to recover ALL Phase 6 testing decisions
2. Read the most recent testing-category decisions to reconstruct context
3. Record the user's feedback as a new testing decision
4. Update exit criteria based on feedback (mark_exit_criterion for manual_testing, edge_cases)
5. If issues found: fix them, then record updated status

**WHEN fixing issues from manual testing:**
After each fix, record a testing decision noting: what was fixed, what still needs retesting.
This ensures the NEXT session knows exactly what changed since the last test round.

### Next Step (MANDATORY when all testing is complete):
Both automated and manual testing must be done before advancing. When both gates are \u2705: call advance_phase() to move to Phase 7. Then call get_phase_guidance() and begin Phase 7 post-review immediately.

**tests_passing is engine-witnessed, not asserted (S4).** advance_phase() to Phase 7 is BLOCKED unless the test-outcome hook actually saw a GREEN run during Phase 6 \u2014 marking tests_passing met is not enough.

**Run the suite with the exit echo so the engine reads the EXIT STATUS, not your runner's prose:**
\`\`\`
<your test command>; echo "VERSUS_TEST_EXIT=$?"
\`\`\`
e.g. \`npm test; echo "VERSUS_TEST_EXIT=$?"\` (or \`pytest; echo "VERSUS_TEST_EXIT=$?"\`, etc.). The engine keys on that number \u2014 the shell's own \`$?\` \u2014 so it works whatever language or format your runner prints in, and you never need to touch the runner to be understood. **Do NOT modify the test runner to satisfy the hook**; append the echo to the command instead. (A recognized runner in English still classifies without the echo, but the echo is the reliable, locale-proof path.) If you switched sessions/models at Step 0, run the suite again in this session so the engine witnesses it. The engine checks that the run was green, not that the tests are adequate \u2014 coverage and meaningfulness are your and the user's judgment.

### Re-verify what earlier phases DECIDED (the method does not otherwise re-check it):
The 2\u21943 loop establishes critical findings and their resolution; Phase 1 establishes premises. Nothing re-checked either survived the code \u2014 in the batch a resolved critical was reintroduced (an O(n\xB2) said to be erased came back in a filter) and a Phase-1 premise (single-thread; streaming migration) was violated by the implementation, both found only by luck. Two artifacts close that:

- **\`specs/validation/critical-coverage.md\` (BLOCKS 6\u21927 when the matrix has \u{1F534} findings):** one row per \u{1F534} critical finding \u2014 its id, and the test that would catch its regression, OR a stated reason there is none (e.g. the module was removed in Phase 3). The engine checks every \u{1F534} id is referenced; whether the test truly covers it is your judgment.
- **\`specs/validation/premise-coverage.md\` (BLOCKS 6\u21927 when the architecture NUMBERS its premises):** one row per numbered premise \u2014 the test that would FAIL if the premise stopped holding, or the reason there is none. "A premise is only protected when a test would measure it failing." Criticising a premise's plausibility in Phase 2 is not the same as measuring whether it holds in the built system. (If your architecture writes premises as prose, this gate stays silent \u2014 but numbering them, per Phase 1, is what lets it protect them.)

### Detection power \u2014 a green suite that CANNOT fail on the defect is not protection (strong recommendation):
Five shapes of "green but doesn't test" appeared in the batch: wrong scenario, partial coverage of the finding, a condition that is unreachable (a window check where the guard could never be false), an invariant true by construction, a test that fails without a defect. A passing test says nothing until you know it *could* fail. Where the stack has a mutation-testing tool, run it on the modules that address criticals \u2014 it was adopted spontaneously in 4/12 projects and caught exactly the unreachable-condition case a 62-test green suite missed. Where it does not, argue detection power by hand: for each critical, state the mutation that would make its test fail. This is a recommendation, not a gate \u2014 mutation tooling is not universal.

### Four practices that paid off in the batch (adopt them \u2014 the agents already reach for them):
1. **Measure by stage before optimizing.** In 4/12 the performance guess was wrong in all four (the bottleneck was fsync at 37 ms/commit, not parsing). Profile, then optimize the measured hot spot.
2. **Micro-check by RUNNING, not reading.** Defects surfaced by executing the module, not by re-reading it (one project: 6 defects found by running, 0 by reading).
3. **Mutation testing** where available \u2014 see detection power above.
4. **Derive the test map from the specs, not the code.** A test written from the code re-asserts the code; one written from the spec can catch the code \u2014 and it also catches errors in the specs (one project found a documented struct size of 20 that \`calcsize\` put at 16).

### Recording a test fix: name the SCENARIO, not just the assertion.
When you change a test after a failure, the record must say which scenario the test now builds \u2014 not only which number/assertion moved. A fix that only swaps the expected value can turn a test into one that exercises the happy path without noticing, and the next failure looks like the same one.`;
var PHASE_7_GUIDANCE = `## Phase 7 \u2014 Post-Review
### Verification: Human-AV (operator confirms product works and captures project lessons)

### Step 1 \u2014 Update specs/:
- specs/validation \u2192 actual results (expected vs obtained)
- specs/technical \u2192 final decisions, discarded algorithms and why
- specs/references \u2192 references discovered during implementation

### Step 2 \u2014 Product evaluation (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY in chat):
Ask the user via AskUserQuestion: does the software meet the P0 requirements? What was missed? Any pending issues to carry into v2?

### Step 3 \u2014 Project lessons (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY as list in chat):
Capture 3-5 lessons about THIS project (not about the methodology):
- Domain insights that emerged during implementation (edge cases, invariants, constraints discovered)
- Tech stack pitfalls encountered (library quirks, integration gotchas, performance surprises)
- Patterns that worked / didn't work for this project's specific constraints
- Assumptions from P0/P1 that turned out wrong

Write the lessons to \`specs/references/lessons.md\` \u2014 the persisted record that feeds the next cycle. start_new_cycle() is BLOCKED until \`specs/references/lessons.md\` exists and is non-trivial; marking lessons_documented met is not enough. This is what lets a v2 (or a post-mortem) actually read what this cycle learned instead of it vanishing with the chat.

### Meta-iteration v1.0 \u2192 v2.0 (\u26A0\uFE0F MUST DISPLAY offer in chat):
After completing all Phase 7 steps, you MUST offer the user the option to start a new development cycle via AskUserQuestion:
- Option 1: "Start v2.0 cycle" \u2014 calls start_new_cycle() to reset to Phase 0 while preserving all context
- Option 2: "Project complete" \u2014 no further action, methodology concludes

If the user chooses to start a new cycle:
1. Call start_new_cycle() \u2014 this preserves decisions, projectSpec, history, and specs/
2. specs/ from the previous cycle is the BASELINE \u2014 knowledge is NOT lost between cycles
3. Phase 0 of the new cycle starts from existing specs/ (doesn't restart from zero)
4. Previous decisions (get_decisions) serve as context \u2014 what was discarded and why
5. Negative scope from the previous cycle can become new scope (with operator approval)
6. Phase 7 lessons feed into the new cycle's process
7. **REVERSE LLM SWITCH \u2014 a decision, not a notice (when start_new_cycle returns \`_modelSwitchAction\`):** The new cycle starts at Phase 0 (design), which needs the MOST CAPABLE model (e.g., Opus). If the user switched to a code-execution model (e.g., Sonnet) at the previous cycle's P4\u2192P5 switch, they are likely still on it. Display the recommendation from the \`_modelSwitchAction\` field, then **ask the user to decide in chat (R2 format):**
   - **"Switch model" (Recommended \u2014 Phase 0 design benefits from the most capable model)** \u2014 close this chat, open a new one with the design-grade model, type \`retomar Versus\`
   - **"Continue here"** \u2014 proceed with Phase 0 on the current model

   This is a DECISION, not a notice. Do NOT display the recommendation and then load Phase 0 and proceed \u2014 announcing and proceeding puts the burden of interrupting on the user, at the one moment where the choice is cheapest to make (before the new cycle's design work begins).
8. If the user chose "Switch model": call record_decision(phase=0, category='process', content='LLM SWITCH (reverse): user will resume Phase 0 of the new cycle in a new chat with <model>') and STOP your response. Do not load Phase 0 guidance.
9. If the user chose "Continue here": call get_phase_guidance() to load Phase 0 instructions for the new cycle.

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use init_project() for meta-iteration \u2014 that wipes all previous context. Use start_new_cycle() which preserves the knowledge base.`;
